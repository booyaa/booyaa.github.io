_This is part of the blog post series: [AWS DevOps Pro Certification](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-intro/)_

## Caveat emptor

Using AWS costs money, some of these services may not be part of the AWS [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/). You can keep costs down by tearing down anything you've created whilst learning, but it's still possible to run up a hefty bill so pay attention to the instances you setup!

I'm very lucky to be able to use my employer's AWS account. You should ask your place of work if a similar arrangement can be made as part of your study.

## Velocius quam asparagi conquantur

The format of the blog posts is liable to change as I try to refine my mental model of each domain, so be sure to revisit the blog posts on a regular basis.

## What?

Elastic Beanstalk...

- is a Platform as a Service (just like Heroku, Netlify), you deploy your code and it provisions the servers you need to get your app running.
- is powered by CloudFormation behind the scene.
- (Elastic Beanstalk) Extensions are the equivalent of User Data field for EC2 instances, in that you can add some tasks that need to run during the provisioning of servers i.e. enable automatic updates on windows.
- comes with a cli (eb), this is primarily aimed at developer giving them a similar PaaS experience to other providers like Heroku i.e. link your version control system (Git, etc) and Elastic Beanstalk will do the rest. There's a lot of simplification in the eb cli versus the aws cli e.g. `eb create my-env` (which creates an environment) would require three aws cli Elastic Beanstalk commands: `check-dns-availability`, `create-application-version` and `create-environment`.

Additional resources:

- dev.to tag for [Elastic Beanstalk][devto_elasticbeanstalk]
- [Elastic Beanstalk FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/faqs/)
- [Elastic Beanstalk User Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
- [Elastic Beanstalk API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/Welcome.html)
- [Elastic Beanstalk CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/index.html)

## Why?

Of all the Orchestration tools provided by AWS, this is probably the easiest to use. Just like Heroku which pioneered this method of simplifying the application deployments, this is aimed at Developers who don't want to get involved in the operational side of provisioning infrastructure.

Recall the level of complexity around CloudFormation, this isn't for everyone.

## When?

- Time poor or not willing to learn a more complex, but ultimately highly configurable Orchestration tool like CloudFormation.
- Don't have a sysadmin handy
- Want to release your application quickly and not worry about the details around the infrastructure.

## How?

We're going to work through one of the [example apps][docs_apps] provided by AWS, download the Go example (`go-v1.zip`). The environment setup commands were cribbed from [user guide][docs_cli] too.

Important: You'll need an S3 bucket to store the solution.

```bash
export APP_NAME=hello-eb
export APP_BUCKET=your-bucket

# copy the zip file to your bucket
aws s3 cp path/to/downloaded/go-v1.zip s3://$APP_BUCKET/

# create the application
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application --application-name $APP_NAME

# Let's tear down

aws elasticbeanstalk terminate-environment \
    --environment-name $APP_NAME-env

aws elasticbeanstalk delete-configuration-template \
    --application-name $APP_NAME --template-name v1

aws elasticbeanstalk delete-application \
    --application-name $APP_NAME
```

N.B. I've noticed there's some delay in deleting the application. You may need to check on the AWS console to confirm all the resources have been deleted.
