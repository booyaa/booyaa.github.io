At some point in your xml wrangling career you will hit an node whose data is
too big for Oracle's `EXTRACTVALUE` (I think the upper limit is 4000
characters) and get this lovely message.

```
ORA-01706: user function result value was too large
01706. 00000 -  "user function result value was too large"
```

To mitigate this problem, you need to switch to **XMLTABLE** and it's useful
*PASSING* attribute:

```sql
SELECT
    fix.biggie AS notorious
FROM
    source_table_with_xmltype_column o,
    XMLTABLE ( '/*'
        PASSING o.xml_field COLUMNS
            biggie VARCHAR2(4000) PATH 'substring(/path/to/offending/item/text(),1,3999)'
    ) fix;
```

The gist of the fix is to use xpath to truncate the text value before it's
handed off to Oracle. Trying to cast the `xmltype` column as a `varchar2(4000)`
will not fix it because the problem happens as **extractvalue** is parsing the
node.
