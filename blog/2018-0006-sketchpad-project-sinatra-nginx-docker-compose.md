I recently came across a monolithic application at work that used various frameworks, which in turn made extending existing routes very difficult to implement.

The general consensus amongst my peers was to stick a proxy in front of the application. The only decision left was to determine if we could do this using the existing reverse proxy ([Nginx][link_nginx]), or write a bespoke proxy (between Nginx and the existing monolith).

The requirement for the proxy was to take a value in the URL, and pass it on as a request parameter to the monolith.

An example incoming URL might look like this `/api/parp/foo`. We want this URL to be rewritten to the monolith as `/api/foo` and `parp` to be appended to the request parameter as value for the key `fart_noise`. The only liberty I've taken with the solution is that the value of `fart_noise` will always be `parp` in this scenario.

You can do this easily enough in Nginx using [`proxy_set_body`][link_nginx_proxy_set] directive.

In addition to this requirement, I needed to leave incoming URLs without `parp` as-is, this is because we expect the client to provide an alternative value for `fart_noise` i.e. `toot`.

I created a test server to simulate the monolith using [Sinatra][link_sinatra]. Which is great for creating REST based APIs, I think it actually edges [Flask][link_flask] out for simplicity.

I used the [`namespace`][link_sinatra_namespace] directive to add prefix `/api` to the existing end points i.e. `/api/foo`. I only needed to prove the URL rewrites would work for `GET` and `POST` methods, so I echoed the `params` variable back as a response which allowed me to verify the parameters were being modified correctly.

```ruby
class MyWay < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::Namespace
  namespace '/api' do
    get '/foo' do
      logger.info "api/foo parameters: #{params}"
      params.inspect
    end

    post '/bar' do
      logger.info "api/bar parameters: #{params}"
      params.inspect
    end
  end
end
```

The Nginx config is a fairly standard reverse proxy setup. The only modification that I did was to created two [location][link_nginx_location] blocks: one to handle the rewrite and appending a parameter to the request, and the other for URLs that did not need modification.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    location /api/parp { # fix parps
        rewrite (.*)/parp/(.*) /$1/$2 break;
        proxy_set_body $request_body&fart_noise=parp;
        # other proxy directives...
    }

    location /api { # leave as-is
        # other proxy directives...
    }
}
```

Obviously I didn't come up with this conclusion immediately, I needed some kind of sketchpad / scratch space to try out the various ideas for rewriting the requests. Enter `docker-compose`, a handy way to join a bunch of containers together without having brain meltdown from remembering the various incantations that are the individual docker commands.

Here's the `docker-compose.yml` I used:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: ./app
    command: ["bundle","exec","rackup","--host","0.0.0.0","--port","4567"]
    volumes:
      - ./app/:/app
  proxy:
    image: nginx
    command: ["nginx-debug", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    volumes:
      - ./proxy/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    depends_on:
      - app
```

The items you may find useful are:

- the `proxy` (Nginx) is dependant on `app` (Sinatra) starting up first 
- we're using `volumes` to get the nginx container to read our `nginx.conf`, removing the need for a pointless `Dockerfile` that copies this file.

You can see the whole project on [GitHub][link_github].

Shrewd readers will notice (in the repo) that `parp` isn't the item in the URL that we wanted to change. The problem was actually that there are different versions of the data set. Some view this as a change to the API therefore requiring a version tag in the URL. Others do not, which is why `version` was being passed as a parameter.
