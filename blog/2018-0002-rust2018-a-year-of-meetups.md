As I write this post, it dawns on me that we've been organising the London Rust meet-ups for over a year. The team started with Vlad and I part way through 2016, by showing the enthusiasm for want to get the meet-ups going again we inadvertently became the new organisers!

Of course we was very lucky that London was the host of the Mozilla "All Hands" event (where Mozilla employees converge on one city and work together for a week) in June. So I also got a bonus of having a large chunk of the Rust Core team descend on our humble group that [June](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/231332388/).

I did worry that after such an start, wether we would be able to sustain it, but as the numbers will show these fears were unfounded.

During 2017 we managed to host 14 meet ups:
- 7 x talks 34, 63, 41, 74, 66, 55, 65 = 395 / 7 = 56.85 avg
- 6 x hack and learns 62, 22, 24, 22, 19, 35 = 184 / 6 = 30.66 avg
- 1 x show and tell 22

# My favourite talks

# Lessons learnt

## time keeping

## better remote speaker experience


# So what's in store for 2018?

- 51% attendees will be female (should I be using identify as female) or non-binary
  - Will be lots of friends to help me achieve, but I plan to have an official CoC. We've been very lucky so far to not have an incident.
  - Extend the team so we can respond to CoC violations, but also to share the work load (compere, admin, speakers).
  - Workshops to introduce people to Rust. Conferences and other interested user groups.
- More home grown speakers.
- Rust Bridge
