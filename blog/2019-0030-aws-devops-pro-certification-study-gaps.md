_This is part of the blog post series: [AWS DevOps Pro Certification](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-intro/)_

## Caveat emptor

Using AWS costs money, some of these services may not be part of the AWS [Free Tier][aws_free_tier]. You can keep costs down by tearing down anything you've created whilst learning, but it's still possible to run up a hefty bill so pay attention to the instances you setup!

I'm very lucky to be able to use my employer's AWS account. You should ask your place of work if a similar arrangement can be made as part of your study.

## Velocius quam asparagi conquantur

The format of the blog posts is liable to change as I try to refine my mental model of each domain, so be sure to revisit the blog posts on a regular basis.

## Study Gaps

This section will change a lot as I find new gaps whilst sitting in mock exams.

I've had a go at the [sample exam][aws_sample_exam] under exam condititions (which before AWS made the exams adaptive would leave you with about 2 mins per question). Here's some items where I need to fill in gaps:

### General

- Knowing which services are able to use [Resource Based Policies][iam_services]:
  - Lambda ([Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-configuration-management-and-infrastructure-as-code-intro)).
  - ECR (via ECS - [Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-configuration-management-and-infrastructure-as-code-intro)).
  - CloudWatch Logs ([Monitoring and Logging](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-monitoring-and-logging)).
  - AWS Secrets Manager ([Policies and Standards Automation](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-policy-standards-automation/)).

### SDLC Automation

- Need to read the [blue/green][devopswp_bluegreen] whitepaper ([SLDC automation](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-sdlc-intro/)). Pssst if you have the time you should read all the [DevOps][devopswp] related whitepapers!

### Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code

- Lambda
  - Deploying new versions
  - What triggers are available
    - API Gateway
    - AWS IoT
    - Application Load Balancer
    - CloudWatch Events ([Monitoring and Logging](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-monitoring-and-logging))
    - CloudWatch Logs ([Monitoring and Logging](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-monitoring-and-logging))
    - CodeCommit ([SLDC automation](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-sdlc-intro/))
    - Cognito Sync Trigger
    - DynamoDB ([High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-high-availability-fault-tolerance-disaster-recover/))
    - Kinesis ([Incident and Event Response](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-incident-and-event-response/))
    - Also doesn't hurt to know the following services are supported: S3,SNS and SQS

### Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch events for the [services][cw_service_events] covered in the exam
  - SDLC Automation
    - CodeCommit
    - CodeBuild
    - CodeDeploy
    - CodePipeline
  - Configuration Management and Infrastrcuture as Code
    - AWS Config
    - AWS OpsWorks
    - AWS (Lambda) Step Functions
    - AWS ECS
  - Monitoring and Logging
    - CloudWatch (scheduled events)
  - Policies and Standards Automation
    - Amazon Macie
    - AWS Systems Manager
      - Configuration Compliance
      - Maintenance Windows
      - Parameter Store
    - Trusted Advisor
  - Incident and Event Reporting
    - Amazon GuardDuty
  - Fault Tolerance, High Availability and Disaster Recovery
    - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
### Fault Tolerance, High Availability and Disaster Recovery

- RDS
  - snapshots and their use in a DR situation. ([High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-high-availability-fault-tolerance-disaster-recover/)).
  - Understanding Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) with DR in mind. ([High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-high-availability-fault-tolerance-disaster-recover/)).

### Policies and Standards Automation

- AWS Systems Manager - EC2 patch groups and Patch Manager's baselines ([Policies and Standards Automation](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-policy-standards-automation/))
- AWS Service Catalogue - how to offer products that provide different tiers (web, web + db) or stacks (.NET or Ruby) ([Policies and Standards Automation](/2019/aws-devops-pro-certification-policy-standards-automation/))
