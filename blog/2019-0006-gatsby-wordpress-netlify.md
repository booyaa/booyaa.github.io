We’re done with our new site, it’s time to setup Netlify.

- Install `gatsby-cli` in your repo (netlify needs it to build your site): `npm install --save gatsby-cli`
- Get your node version `node -v` and stick it in `.nvmrc` to pin netlify to the version you used to build the site (note: don’t include the `v` in version number i.e. `v11.3.0` becomes  `11.3.0`
- Complete netlify setup up to step 5, but don’t hit deploy: [A Step-by-Step Guide: Gatsby on Netlify | Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/#connecting-to-netlify)
- Expand `advanced build settings`

Remember those environmental variables we set up on `gatsby-config.js`? It’s time add them up in Netlify.

Let’s the click deploy button to publish the site. If there were any errors, check out the logs in the Deploys section of your Netlify site.
