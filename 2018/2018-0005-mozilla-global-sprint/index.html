      <h1>Mozilla Global Sprint</h1>
       
      
      
      								
          
    	 

			<time pubdate="pubdate">May 13, 2018 - Reading time: 4 minutes.</time><br />
      
      <p>I wanted to share my experience of participating at <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/2018-projects/">Mozilla's Global Sprint 2018</a>. The Global Sprint runs once a year and is a two day hackathon event. The projects you can work on, have a central focus of promoting a healthy Internet.</p>
<p>At last count there were 145 projects that you could participate in during the sprint, including a certain project called: <a href="https://github.com/rust-community/content-o-tron">Content-o-Tron</a>, but more on this later!</p>
<h2>Open Leaders Programme</h2>
<p>A significant amount of the projects that were submitted for this year's sprint came from an excellent programme run by Mozilla called <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/">Open Leaders</a>. This is a 14-week online course on working open, which will help you take an idea and turn it into a project that is ready to accept contributors from all over the world.</p>
<p>I've participated in lots of Open Source projects, and even created a few of my own. So you would think I would be well versed in &quot;Working Open&quot;, but this course has taught me so much more!</p>
<p>I plan to write a separate blog post about the programme, but I will say that if you are looking to harness the power of crowd sourcing, I recommend that you <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/">apply</a> when applications are accepted in 2019!</p>
<h2>Content-o-Tron</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-community/content-o-tron">Content-o-Tron</a> is the evolution of an idea that I submitted as part of my application for the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/">Open Leaders</a> programme. </p>
<p>Whilst on the programme, I have watched my project evolve from something that would generate more &quot;Rust&quot; content into a toolkit that can be used to grow diversity and inclusivity in communities.</p>
<p>My personal ambition is for this project to be a stand alone resource that can referenced like <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/">Open Leaders</a> or <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a>.</p>
<h2>A Sprint Finish for Content-o-Tron</h2>
<h3>Pre-sprint</h3>
<p>A few weeks before the sprint, I started creating tasks (GitHub issues) labelled as <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-7057ff.svg" alt="good_first_issue" />. Previously these would've been tasks that I would fixed myself (fix typos, or write introductory text), but it was time to start sharing the work.</p>
<p>I also spent a lot of time spamming <a href="https://twitter.com/booyaa/status/990972718278377473">twitter</a> and keeping a thread of all related #mozsprint tweets.</p>
<h3>Sprint-eve</h3>
<p>Support from friends and family is incredibly important. I had a big confidence boost, when my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Argorak">Florian</a> told me he would be checking in occassionally and helping out with a few of the tasks!</p>
<h3>Sprint Days</h3>
<p>I was planning to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> as a way to coordinate with contributors in real time (versus commenting in GitHub Issues). In the end I decided to use <a href="https://gitter.im/">gitter</a>, because I felt it would be easier to setup (it's web based) and has a good initial user experience. Also most of the sprint participants would already have GitHub accounts (which is a single sign on option in gitter).</p>
<p>I also created a tracking issue for the <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/">Global Sprint</a>. This is an issue where people go to register their intent to help out on the project. I then used <a href="https://bit.ly/">bit.ly</a> to create a memorable URL to this tracking issue  (<code>bit.ly/cot-sprint-18</code>) so it would be easier to share out during our video call &quot;pitches&quot;.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before people started to contribute, it was interesting to see the team dynamics change as more people started to join. I like to think that because myself and Florian greeted people (in gitter) and responded to queries in a timely manner this set the tone for collaboration.</p>
<p>Once someone had contributed to the project I immediately made them a maintainer of the repository. I wanted to remove any potential barriers, that could prevent them from getting things done. This had the added advantage of making more reviewers for PRs.</p>
<p>When I resumed work on day two of the sprint, it was thrilling to see that people had continued to work on the project overnight. This meant I had provided enough work and that the instructions were clear.</p>
<p>Here's a snapshot of the activity on the project during the sprint. I couldn't capture the activity for the two days, so this may have included some last minutes fixes on Sprint-eve.</p>
<p><img src="/img/content-o-tron-pulse.png" alt="github_pulse" /></p>
<p>I did some further analysis and concluded the following occurred during the sprint.</p>
<ul>
<li>11 out of 12 pull requests closed.</li>
<li>9 out of 23 tasks (issues) closed that were labelled <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-mozsprint-4faeb5.svg" alt="mozsprint" />.  (excluding the tracking issue)</li>
<li>10 issues labelled as <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-good%20first%20issue-7057ff.svg" alt="good_first_issue" />. .</li>
<li>4 out of 10 issues closed that were labelled <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-no%20code-fbca04.svg" alt="no_code" />.  (did not require software development).</li>
<li>2 issues that were labelled <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-code-5e9ced.svg" alt="code" />.  that required development. One of the issues (curation tool) is pending peer review, so could potentially be closed soon.</li>
</ul>
