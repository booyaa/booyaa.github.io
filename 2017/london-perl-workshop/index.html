      <p>Almost a month a go, around the same time as <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla
Fest</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/neilbowers">Neil
Bowers</a> put out a request for a Rust talk via
twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would love someone to give an intro talk on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rustlang?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rustlang</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lpw2017?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#lpw2017</a><br>20 minute intro from anyone?</p>â€” Neil Bowers (@neilbowers) <a href="https://twitter.com/neilbowers/status/923984954752667648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></p>

<p>This was my first request for a Rust talk at a conference! I'm glad I didn't think too hard about that fact, as I suspect I would've been more freaked out!</p>
<p>The talk submission process, as well as the communications leading up to the event were excellent. One of the nicest emails, was tips for new speakers, it was like having a distilled version of Scott Hanselman's speaking tips.</p>
<p>I managed to attend two talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abigail's [Regexp Mini-Tutorial: Character Classes]</li>
<li>Sue Spence's [Spiders, Gophers &amp; Butterflies]</li>
</ul>
<p>I was surprised at how much Regexp's character classes had expanded to accommodate unicode characters. I thought the class properties were very descriptive. It was nice to see Perl continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Sue's talk was about concurrency and the differences between implementation of a webspider in Go and Perl 6. It inspired me to have a go in Rust to see how comparable to the other two languages. I found Perl 6's syntax easier to read.</p>
<p>My talk was well attended, I managed to do my own take on the famous &quot;Control/Safety&quot; spectrum of programming languages. A few days earlier, I tested the talk on our local Rust user group and got invaluable feedback. Despite having to rejigging the slides I still managed to deliver the Introduction to Rust in time!</p>
<p>The people who I met at the conference were lovely. The AV staff and volunteers were incredibly helpful. I'd recommend submitting a talk for London Perl Workshop 2018!</p>
<p>My deck can be found at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/booyaa/introduction-to-rust-lpw-2017">SpeckerDeck</a>.</p>
<p>The video will follow shortly, I will update this post when it's available.</p>
