## Which exntesion?

First off if you can, you should be using the Rust Language Server
[extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust).
Yes it's alpha, but the user experience has been the best I've had, outside of
in-house language support by giants like Microsoft and JetBrains! The extension
does everything for you if you have [rustup](http://rustup.rs/) installed!
