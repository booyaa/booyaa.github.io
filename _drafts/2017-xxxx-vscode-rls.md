I first heard about the Rust Language Server (RLS), via Phil Dawes' Racer talk at the
[4th London Rust User
Group](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-London-User-Group/events/229413056/).
Immediately I knew the significance of this strategy and how it would reduce
the friction required to get Rust working on the vast array of editors and
IDEs.

It was around this time I switched from using vim to Visual Studio Code as my primary editor. 
I started using RLS the moment it could build, previously I used the now defunct Rusty Code extension.
