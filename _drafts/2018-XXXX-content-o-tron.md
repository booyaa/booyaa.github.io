## What is Content-o-Tron

Content-o-Tron is project to help amplify the lesser heard voices in the Rust community. 

We are able to do this by providing editorial assistance and technical reviews of draft blog posts.

Once your blog post is ready to publish we will ensure it is deseminated through various channels such as ReadRust, MozHacks, social networks and of course the Rust Community's own blog on community.rs.

## Why do we need Content-o-Tron

The short form of writing i.e. Twitter, Mastodon, Rust User Forums (URLO) are good, but lack the ability to express detail and are often hampered by the fact that those thoughts vanish from most peoples timelines in a matter of minutes.

Speaking from personal experience, it can be daunting to start a blog post. Yet it's often a great measure of our understanding of key concepts and ideas for topic we are studying.

The things I've found that have held me back are:

- Needing editorial assistance to catch typos, or words that I have missed out.
- Not wanting to look like idiot in front of the community because I misunderstood how something worked.
- Who wants to read or care about what I want to say.

The last item on the list, is pretty much the sole purpose of Content-o-Tron. The Rust community loves hearing about your experiments, how you go abouts learning Rust or how your trial at work is going. In short we want to hear about what you're doing with Rust either directly writing code, contributing to the various Rust projects or how your local Rust meetup is going.

## How did Content-o-Tron happen

Last year the Rust Community team created new sub teams to concentrate on various roles the team play a part in: Events, RustBridge,  i18n and l10n; Surveys and Content.

I lead the Content team, whose goal (from our description in the [team][link_rust_comm_team] project):

> Organize and write for the community blog and other publication outlets; organize and promote material like videos and podcasts; provide lectorate (copy editing) and assistance for people that want to write blog posts on rust.

Lacking the experience of leading a team, I decided to seek help and signed up for the [Mozilla Open Leadership][link_mol] programme. I've written about my experience on the programme in the following blog post: [Mozilla Global Sprint][link_moz_global_sprint]. I highly recommend you join, if you want to help foster a healthy community around your project.

During my time on this programme, one phrase in our team's goal would help me define the Content-o-Tron project: _provide lectorate (copy editing) and assistance for people that want to write blog posts on rust_

## Our progress so far

The culimination of the Mozilla Open Leadership programme is to show case your project during the Mozilla Global Sprint. This is a two day long hackathon where lots of wonderful volunteers offer to help you work on your project.

During the the sprint, we had a new mascot created and finished two guides. We've run two campaigns.

## Where we want to be (our goal)
