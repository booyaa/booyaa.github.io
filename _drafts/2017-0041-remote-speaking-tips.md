On Monday I did my first remote talk (for the Rust Edinburgh user group). I
thought I'd share the experience.

## tl;dr - here's a check list:

- Get a good quality headset.
- Do a mirror (selfie) test, make sure there's no embarrassing stuff in the background.
- More slides, to repeat reenforcement of ideas and concepts.
- Don't ramble, short sound bites are better.
- Do a test video conference call beforehand.
- Pre bake your demos unless you're a live coding veteran.

## Gear

Get a decent headset, do not use your internal microphone on your computer! I
borrowed a pair of HyperX II off my better half, they're her gaming headphones,
but they also function excellent for video conferencing duty.

The only acceptable low-fi alternative is a pair of head phones that you use
for hands free. The ones that come bundled with iPhone are surprisingly good
for this task.

## Setup

If this is your first time to do video conferencing, then do a mirror or selfie
test. In google hangout you can do this by clicking on the video call icon.

Look around you, is there anything that you wouldn't want to appear in the
background? Our home office is our guest bedroom and where we keep our clothes
dryer. You get the idea. Bonus points if you can stick cool posters or a talk
related paraphernalia (mascots and the like) in the background!

## Deck Design

This is the area that I'm still trying to master, so I will prolly revisit as a
separate post. But I was given tips by those more experienced than myself. Keep
the detail on each slide, light, but also repeat or re-iterate the concepts or
ideas you're trying to get across. You no longer have the advantage of seeing
the audience reaction i.e. how well they're grasping the subject matter.

## Tools

At the moment I'm still using Google Hangout to conduct my remote talks. Provided both parties have Chrome, it's zero software install. I do have concerns, in particular the lack of multi-display support (more on this in a moment) and the inability to increase the size of the other party's video window.

### Multi display (or lack of)

When doing talks in person, nearly all AV setups allow you to use the projector/TV as an additional display. This allows me to configure Keynote (Mac presentation tool) in presenter mode. The slides appear on the project/TV as you would expect and on your own computer's display you can see the time elapsed, next slide and slide notes.

Google hangout allows you to share your screen in two modes: full screen or application. Neither modes are multi display aware. The application mode has the added confusion

 use When using Keynote (Mac presentation tool)
- Google Hangout - Video conferencing/Screensharing tool
- HyperX II - Head set ()
- Keynote - Presentation
- Visual Studio Code - Live coding


prepare (on the day)

- own sound check (you can record audio in keynote)
- test hangout

gotchas

- do not use your comp's builtin mic it's not good enough
- when you go full screen in keynote you'll lose your presentation notes. use the keynote on an iphone (or ipad) as a remote, you'll get notes and the bonus of having clicker.
