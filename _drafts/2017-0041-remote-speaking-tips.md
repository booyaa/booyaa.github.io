This Monday I did my first remote talk (for the Rust Edinburgh user group). I thought I'd share the experience so it might help others.

Deck Design


tools

- Google Hangout - Video conferencing/Screensharing tool
- HyperX II - Head set ()
- Keynote - Presentation
- Visual Studio Code - Live coding


prepare (on the day)

- own sound check (you can record audio in keynote)
- test hangout

gotchas

- do not use your comp's builtin mic it's not good enough
- when you go full screen in keynote you'll lose your presentation notes. use the keynote on an iphone (or ipad) as a remote, you'll get notes and the bonus of having clicker.
